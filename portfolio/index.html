        <p id="para">As the founder and CEO of selflearnwithus, I lead a team of developers and designers to create web and mobile applications that empower citizens to participate in social and environmental initiatives. We have successfully launched several projects, such as a platform that connects volunteers with NGOs, a app that tracks and rewards waste reduction, and a website that showcases local green businesses.
    
            I am also the founder of SelfLearnWithUs, a blog and online community that provides resources and guidance for self-taught learners. Through my blog, I share my experiences and insights on various topics, such as web development, data science, and entrepreneurship. I have received multiple awards and recognition for my work, such as the Best Educational Blogger from Rotary Business Awards, and the Second Prize in Olimayam 2.0, a national-level hackathon.
            
            In addition to my entrepreneurial ventures, I am pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science at Knowledge Institute of Technology, where I am honing my technical skills and knowledge. I have completed several certifications, such as Certified Data Scientist, Introduction to Programming Using Python, and Full-Stack Web Development. I am also an active member of the Indian Society for Technical Education, and have conducted workshops and seminars on web development and data analysis.
            
            I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and create positive impact. I have a strong analytical mindset, a creative flair, and a collaborative approach. I am always eager to learn new skills, explore new opportunities, and challenge myself. My goal is to become a successful and innovative leader in the tech industry, and to inspire and empower others to achieve their potential.</p>
